The apex of your trajectory just barely reaches the surface of a large island floating in the sky. You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. It\'s quite cold, but you don\'t see much snow. An Elf runs over to greet you.\n\nThe Elf explains that you\'ve arrived at *Snow Island* and apologizes for the lack of snow. He\'ll be happy to explain the situation, but it\'s a bit of a walk, so you have some time. They don\'t get many visitors up here;would you like to play a gamein the meantime?\n\nAs you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.\n\nTo get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He\'ll do this a few times per game.\n\nYou play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the `11` in `Game 11: ...` ) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like `3 red, 5 green, 4 blue` ).\n\nFor example, the record of a few games might look like this:\n\n```\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\nGame 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\nGame 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\nGame 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\n```\n\nIn game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.\n\nThe Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained *only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes* ?\n\nIn the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been *possible* if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have been *impossible* because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been *impossible* because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get `<em>8</em>` .\n\nDetermine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. *What is the sum of the IDs of those games?* \n\n\n",description_2:Some("\n<span id=\"part2\"></span>\n## --- Part Two ---\n\n\nThe Elf says they\'ve stopped producing snow because they aren\'t getting any *water* ! He isn\'t sure why the water stopped; however, he can show you how to get to the water source to check it out for yourself. It\'s just up ahead!\n\nAs you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you played, what is the *fewest number of cubes of each color* that could have been in the bag to make the game possible?\n\nAgain consider the example games from earlier:\n\n```\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\nGame 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\nGame 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\nGame 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\n```\n\n- In game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible.\n- Game 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes.\n- Game 3 must have been played with at least 20 red, 13 green, and 6 blue cubes.\n- Game 4 required at least 14 red, 3 green, and 15 blue cubes.\n- Game 5 needed no fewer than 6 red, 3 green, and 2 blue cubes in the bag.\n\nThe *power* of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together. The power of the minimum set of cubes in game 1 is `48` . In games 2-5 it was `12` , `1560` , `630` , and `36` , respectively. Adding up these five powers produces the sum `<em>2286</em>` .\n\nFor each game, find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present. *What is the sum of the power of these sets?* \n\n\n"))
